![corebiz](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61589484/116228402-9f1f6800-a72b-11eb-812a-c1c1ef124a41.jpg)


## Used technologies: ðŸ”§
<ul>
  <li>HTML5 + CSS3 (Sass)</li>
  <li>ReactJS, TypeScript and NextJS</li>
</ul>

## How to view the project? ðŸ‘€

Ps.: Before you get start, make sure that git, Node and preferably Yarn package manager (â€˜npmâ€™ works too), are installed. You can download these tools right here: [GIT](https://git-scm.com/), [NODE](https://nodejs.org/en/) e [YARN](https://yarnpkg.com/cli/install)

Steps:

ðŸ‘‰ 1- Clone this repository in a directory of your choice:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/dev-dougie/corebiz.git
```

ðŸ‘‰ 2 â€“ Install the Next. It will be responsible to render the page on the server side. You can know more about this architecture in this link [here](https://medium.com/techbloghotmart/o-que-%C3%A9-server-side-rendering-e-como-usar-na-pr%C3%A1tica-a840d76a6dca) (Portuguese)
```bash
yarn add next
```
ðŸ‘‰ 3 â€“ After Next added, run the project in development mode. The default host will be: http://localhost:3000/
```bash
yarn dev
```
<hr/>

<h4> But wait a minute, and if you want to simulate the website in production mode? ðŸ¤” </h4>

Itâ€™s simple! First we have to build the project:
```bash
yarn build
```
Now itâ€™s time to start the project simulating a production environment:
```bash
yarn start
```
Ready to take off! ðŸš€
